# ROLIE
Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) specification

The Resource Orientated Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) protocol provides a standardized
mechanism for an SCAP Content Repository that allows security automation content to be discovered,
syndicated, and exchanged. ROLIE is a profile of the Atom Syndication Format and the Atom Publication
Protocol. SCAP Content Repository implementations based on ROLIE will provide organized collections
of SCAP content, vulnerability records, and other security automation data used to automate the
collection and evaluation of endpoint posture.
